# Installation

## Installing the Latest Release

It is recommended to download the latest release directly from Github using [the releases page](https://github.com/W3AXL/RadioConsole2/releases).

Note that you will need to download the correct version of both the console and daemon applications - there are binaries available for both Windows
and Linux. Running the console and daemons on separate devices is supported and encouraged - you can run the console client on your primary PC, and
the daemons on another PC in a different room or even different location!
